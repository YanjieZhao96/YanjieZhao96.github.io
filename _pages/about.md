# üê∞ About Me

I joined [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://hust.edu.cn/) in March 2024, and my collaborating supervisor is [Prof. Haoyu Wang](https://howiepku.github.io/).

In 2019, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.bupt.edu.cn/). Subsequently, I commenced my doctoral studies at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/), where I had the privilege of being supervised by [Prof. Li Li](http://lilicoding.github.io/) and [Prof. John Grundy](https://sites.google.com/site/johncgrundy/). I completed my PhD at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/) in September 2023. 

My research focuses on applications of Large Language Models in software engineering and software security. If you would like to reach me, please send an email to <a href="mailto:yanjie_zhao@hust.edu.cn">yanjie_zhao@hust.edu.cn</a> or <a href="mailto:carolzhao233@gmail.com">carolzhao233@gmail.com</a>.
